# vue-app-template

This template includes a frontend and backend layer and only basic libraries.

### Frontend

The frontend uses vue as its core (obviously) and several useful tools, such as:
- [vuetify](vuetifyjs.com/), which is a vue UI Library with material design
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), which will be used as the promise based HTTP client for the browser
- [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), which is a state management library for Vue (basically a store, which will store the data of your app)
- [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/), which is the official router for Vue

### Backend

The backend only uses three packages.

- [express](https://expressjs.com/), which is a web framework for Node.js
- [Dotenv-flow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-flow), which enables loading of .env variables
- [esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm), which allows the use of ECMAScript syntax
